# project overview
 Kendrick Lamars "Alright"
"Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
*, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
*, I'm at the preacher's door
Im messed up, homie you messed up 
But if god got us then, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be
 alright."
I chose these words because people found community in this song specifically during a time when there were many instances of police brutality happening across the country, and people even used the hook as a chant for protest and it brought people together in a time of rising tensions. It certainly brought those kinds of issues to my attention and helped me make sense of what was happening.   


The site consists of many hover effects that attempt to animate into the main title of the song “Alright”. The typeface will have a sketched look to it as if it were written out on paper.
